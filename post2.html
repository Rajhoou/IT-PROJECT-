        <h1>Western vs. Eastern Philosophy: Mind, Matter & Beyond</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Western philosophy often builds upon logical analysis and individualism, seeking absolute truths through reason and empirical inquiry. Thinkers like Descartes emphasized the **dualism of mind and body**, while Kant introduced the limits of human knowledge through reason.</p>

        <p>Eastern traditions, on the other hand, embrace holistic perspectives. Vedanta dissolves the self into **Brahman, the universal consciousness**, while Zen Buddhism finds wisdom in paradox and direct experience beyond rational concepts.</p>

        <p>Where the West questions **“What can be known?”**, the East often asks **“What is beyond knowing?”** This contrast reveals deeper truths, showing that neither approach is complete without the other.</p>
