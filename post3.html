        <p>Is time real, or just an illusion? In metaphysics, time is not a fixed entity but a perception shaped by consciousness. **Buddhist thought** suggests time is cyclical, dissolving into the impermanence of all things, while physics entertains ideas of time being a mere dimension rather than an absolute flow.</p>

        <p>In Vedanta, **past, present, and future are united**—a manifestation of Maya, the illusion that veils ultimate reality. Meanwhile, Nietzsche’s concept of **Eternal Recurrence** imagines time looping endlessly, forcing us to confront our choices as if living them forever.</p>

        <p>From metaphysics to philosophy, time stands not as an external force, but as a mirror to human understanding—forever debated, never fully grasped.</p>
